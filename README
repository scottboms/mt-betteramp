BetterAmp 1.0.1 for Movable Type
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BetterAmp is a free plugin for Movable Type. It safely rewrites
ampersand characters as an HTML entity reference: "&amp;" and wraps the
entity in a semantically neutral <span> element with a class of "amp",
allowing a method to directly specify CSS styles for ampersand
characters.

Installation
============
BetterAmp requires Movable Type version 4 or later.

1.  Copy the BetterAmp folder into your Movable Type plugins directory.
    If you don't have a plugins directory, create an empty directory
    named "plugins" in your MT server root, and put BetterAmp inside
    that new directory. In other words, your installation should look
    like this:

    (MT home)/plugins/BetterAmp

    If you're using Movable Type's "dynamic publishing" model, you'll
    automatically be able to use the PHP version of the BetterAmp plugin
    which can be found in the php subfolder. Movable Type should
    automatically load this extension for you, at least as of version 4.x.

2.  Now it's time to edit your blog templates. Any tags that might
    contain a stray ampersand should be modified to call
    encode_ampersands. mt:EntryBody is an obvious place to start:

      <mt:EntryBody>

    becomes

      <mt:EntryBody better_amp="1">

    Easy! Ditto for mt:EntryMore, or mt:EntryTitle:

      <mt:EntryMore better_amp="1">
      <mt:EntryTitle better_amp="1">

    You're done.
